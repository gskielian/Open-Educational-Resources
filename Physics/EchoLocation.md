EchoLocation
============

Need to find optimal permutations -- perhaps use NCatelli's Go app for this (finding probability of transistions).

States necessary for group closure:
* Speed of Sound in m   (343 m/s)
* Speed of Sound in cm (34,300 cm/s)
* How echolocator works, bat-analogy
  * one of those produces the pulse
  * one of those receives
  * start the pulse when the trig is high -- only need a blip (can decrease it to 10 microseconds)
  * pulseIn on echoPin gives you a number of microseconds until receive the returning echo.
  * if it is farther away it will take a longer time to receive the echo.
* Need equation for distance.  Use dimensional analysis.
  * use a whiteboard diagram to describe the problem.  find the time it takes to get there and back, find the distance there and back -- oh, but we want just half that distance -- what to do?
  * 343m/s * 100cm/1m
* Multiplying by 1 
 * 1 dozen / 12 eggs.  Same amount of eggs? (Y/N)  10 s * 1,000
* what is a microseconds
 * but really it's an m -- lower case greek m
 * 1,000 pattern in metric/SI system, exception is cm
