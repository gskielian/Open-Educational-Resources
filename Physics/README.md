Physics Labs in JSON
====================

The purpose of this repo is to prepare lesson-plan details in JSON format, so that later on we can have an Angular App
or even some database for filtering the results based on lesson type, common core objectives, budget, time constraint and materials.

Eventually to construct a lesson plan generator which can customize the plan to individual class's needs and provide ease-of-implementation 
presenting budget estimates and direct links to suppliers.
