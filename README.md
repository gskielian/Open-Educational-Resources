Open-Educational-Resources
==========================

Contributing to OER with lessons plans, and descriptions in JSON format (to be formatted later in more generally readable way).

Long-term Goal
--------------

Eventually this will make it easy for some API to mix and match these based on:

* budget
* class size
* space requirement
* lesson timespan


JSON Linter
-----------

In order to make sure that the JSON format is correct, there's this awesome validator:
