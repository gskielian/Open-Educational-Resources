### Open-Curriculum for Classsroom Robotics

From experience, robotics is an extremely exciting for students, but normally a budgetary and curricula hurdles
exist between it and the classroom.

Using the extremely affordable Arduino (can get 20+ arduinos for the cost of one NXT), and choice
sensors, studnets will build their own robot from basic-hardware components.

I am planning for the curriculum will overlap heavily with HS physics common core to allow for it 
to be incorporated into a HS physics curriculum.

### Todo:
At the moment, I am ironing out an open-curriculum for a budget robotics course based on experience
in afterschool robotics programs in VVMS, TechLab, and Galileo HS SF.


### Props:
